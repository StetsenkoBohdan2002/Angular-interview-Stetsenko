<summary>What is different between AngularJS and Angular?</summary>
<div>
<br>
Though many systems still support AngularJS, there are no longer updates or improvements made to the system. Angular 2 is the newer version of AngularJS, and since its release, there have been several improvements and newer versions of the framework. These are some of the primary differences between AngularJS and Angular 2. AngularJS and Angular 2 are both frameworks for developing websites, they use different coding languages. AngularJS uses JavaScript, a text-based coding language used to make interactive elements. Angular 2 uses TypeScript, a subset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that incorporates static type definitions.

<summary>MVC?</summary>
<div>
<br>
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. 
The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:
<ul>
<li>Model: Manages data and business logic.</li>
<li>View: Handles layout and display.</li>
<li>Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.</li>
</ul>

<summary>MVVM?</summary>
<div>
<br>
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is an application architecture design pattern.
The MVVM pattern is divided into three parts:
<ul>
<li>Model is the logic of working with data and a description of the fundamental data necessary for the application to work.</li>
<li>View - a graphical interface (windows, lists, buttons, etc.). Acts as a subscriber to the event of changing the values of properties or commands provided by the ViewModel. If any property has changed in the View Model, it notifies all subscribers about it, and the View, in turn, requests the updated value of the property from the View Model. If the user interacts with any element of the interface, the View calls the appropriate command provided by the View Model.</li>
<li>The ViewModel is, on the one hand, an abstraction of the View, and on the other hand, a data wrapper from the Model to be bound. That is, it contains the Model converted to the View, as well as commands that the View can use to affect the Model.</li>
</ul>
